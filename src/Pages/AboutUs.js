Our main goal is to provide a job for the fresh graduate but we had not to limit ourselves to a single feature, IACS also provide internship, Scholarship, Project funding, and professional training. On the other hand, we IACS also make the recruitment process easier for companies and provide them with qualified and dedicated students.
